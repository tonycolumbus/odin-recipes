            Gnocchi is a soft, pillowy pasta made with potatoes, and it's an extremely versatile dish. Classic gnocchi is typically
            served with <strong>a sauce made from browned butter and sage</strong>, but you can use almost any sauce you like with your pasta!

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>Put the unpeeled potatoes in a large pot. Fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the potatoes by at least 2 inches
                and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, partially cover the pot, and simmer the potatoes
                until they are completely tender and easily pierced with a skewer, 30 to 35 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Drain the potatoes, let them cool just enough that you can handle them, and then peel them. Cut them in half crosswise
                and pass them through a ricer into a large bowl. Let cool until almost at room temperature, at least 20 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>Lightly flour a work surface. In a small bowl, mix the flour with the salt. Add the egg to the potatoes and then add the
                flour mixture. Mix with your hands until the flour is moistened and the dough starts to clump together; the dough will
                still be a bit crumbly at this point. Gather the dough together and press it against the bottom of the bowl until you
                have a uniform mass. Transfer it to the floured surface and wash your hands.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p>Knead gently until the flour is fully incorporated and the dough is soft, smooth, and a little sticky, 30 seconds to 1
                minute. (Don’t overmix it, or the gnocchi will be tough; the dough should feel very delicate.) Move the dough to one
                side, making sure the surface underneath it is well floured. Cover it with a clean kitchen towel.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 5</h4>
                <p>Cover two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment and sprinkle lightly with flour.
                Remove any lingering bits of dough from your work surface and lightly reflour the surface. Tear off a piece of dough
                about the size of a large lemon and put the towel back on the rest of the dough so it doesn’t dry out.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 6</h4>
                <p>With the palms of both hands, roll the dough piece on the floured surface into a rope about 3/4 inch in diameter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 7</h4>
                <p>With a sharp knife or a bench knife, cut the rope crosswise every 3/4 inch to make roughly 3/4-inch-square gnocchi.
                Arrange the gnocchi in a single layer on the parchment-covered baking sheets, making sure they don’t touch. Repeat until
                you run out of dough, reflouring the work surface as needed. When all the gnocchi have been cut and spread out on the
                baking sheets, sprinkle them with a little more flour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 8</h4>
                <p>CBring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat. Add about one-third of the gnocchi. To get the gnocchi
                into the boiling water, fold the parchment ends to form a chute and gently shake the gnocchi out, taking care not to
                clump them together as you drop them in. Give one gentle stir, wait until the gnocchi all float to the surface of the
                water, and then cook them for 1 minute.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, heat 1 Tbs. of the butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter is completely
                melted, use a large slotted spoon or a strainer to transfer the cooked gnocchi from the boiling water to the skillet,
                shaking off as much water as possible first. The gnocchi should form a single layer in the skillet. (If the butter is
                melted before the gnocchi cook, take it off the heat; if the gnocchi cook before the butter is fully melted, it’s fine
                to add the gnocchi.) Sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. salt and cook, shaking the pan occasionally to turn the gnocchi, until
                they’re lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 9</h4>
                <p>CWipe the skillet clean if necessary. Put it over medium-high heat and add the butter. When the butter has almost
                completely melted, stir in the sage leaves. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns a light brown color (be
                careful not to let it burn) and the sage leaves darken and crisp up slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
                <p>Add the reserved gnocchi and the lemon zest to the pan and toss to coat well. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
                Serve immediately.</p>
